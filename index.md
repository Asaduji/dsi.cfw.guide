## What is homebrew?

Homebrew applications are custom, user-made software, which haven't been authorised by Nintendo. This can include save editing tools, games, emulators, and more.

Homebrew can be run for free on your DSi as long as you have a copy of Flipnote Studio.

## What does this guide install?

This guide will install HiyaCFW, a custom firmware for the DSi.

## What is custom firmware?

Custom firmware enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew canâ€™t easily do. For instance, signature patches let you install unsigned titles that appear right on your System Menu.

CFW can be set up on any console on any version.

## What should I know before starting?

- This guide currently only works on USA consoles
  - Support for EUR, AUS and JPN consoles is releasing soon
- Homebrew allows you to modify your system, which could easily result in a brick if done improperly
- Be careful when restoring modified NAND backups and make sure to test them in NO$GBA before restoring them
- Keep your console plugged in at all times during this process to avoid sudden power loss
- You will need an SD card to use this guide
  - Your console should come with one
